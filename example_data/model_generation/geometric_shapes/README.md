## Geometric shapes model generation

Th–µ scripts in this folder show how to generate a 2 layer convolutional neural network with PyTorch to predict the type of shape shown in an image, triangle or circle.

The notebooks in this folder are organized as follows:

- [generate_model.ipynb](generate_model.ipynb) defines a neural network and trains it.
