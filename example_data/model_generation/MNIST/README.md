## Leafsnap model generation

Th–µ scripts in this folder show how to generate a 2-layer convolutional neural network with PyTorch to predict whether images from the binary MNIST dataset depict a handwritten 0 or 1.

The notebooks in this folder are organized as follows:

In this notebook we train models in pytorch for binary MNIST dataset.

- [generate_model_binary.ipynb](generate_model_binary.ipynb) defines a neural network and trains it on the first two classes of MNIST.
- [generate_model_all.py](generate_model_all.py) defines a neural network and trains it on all classes of MNIST.
