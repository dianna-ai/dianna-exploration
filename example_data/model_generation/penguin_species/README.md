## Penguin species classification model generation

Th–µ scripts in this folder show how to generate a 2-layer convolutional neural network with Keras to predict penguin species based on physical characteristics. The data is from the palmerpenguins data-set containing size measurements for three different types of penguin species found in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.

The notebooks in this folder are organized as follows:

- [generate_model.ipynb](generate_model_binary.ipynb) defines a neural network and trains it on the palmer penguins dataset
