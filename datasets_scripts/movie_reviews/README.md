## Movie review sentiment analysis 

This notebook shows how to generate a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to predict the sentiment of a movie review.  
The data set is the Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2, which contains about 70000 sentences.  
For simplicity, we here create a binary classifier: a movie review is either positive or negative.
