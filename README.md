# Deep Insight AND Neural Network Analysis (DIANNA) 
eXplainable AI (XAI) methods made usable by scientists

## Installation

To run some of the notebooks in this repository, you need to install a few dependencies:

- `torch` and `torchvision`
- `captum`
- `wandb`

Installing PyTorch works easiest through conda, because that also installs binary dependencies. If you install through pip and see failures (crashing kernels inside the notebooks when doing training, for instance), then this may be the cause. Install instructions can be found at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

The other libraries are easily installed through pip or conda.
