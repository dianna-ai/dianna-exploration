# Standup checklist

Chair: Chris
Backup: Elena

We aim at finishing the stand up in 25 mins. Longer discussions should be held in another meeting outside the standup.

## Chair reminds the team of the [goal of the sprint](https://github.com/dianna-ai/dianna/projects)

## Chair asks the product owner (if there is one otherwise chair will):

1. What currently needs to be done in order to reach the goal of the sprint?

## Chair asks each individual (Yang, Patrick, Christiaan, Elena, Leon, others?):

1. Is there interesting progress for the rest of the team to know?
1. How much time can you spend until the next stand up?
1. What do you plan to work on until the next stand up? Is it helping us to reach the goal of the sprint?
1. Is anything blocking your progress? Do you need help?

## Collectively

1. Discuss:
   1. [Issues with "standup" labeled](https://github.com/dianna-ai/dianna/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Astandup)
   1. [pull requests](https://github.com/dianna-ai/dianna/pulls)
   1. Does anyone want to do pair programming? Make an appointment.
1. Any other business, e.g.
   - Issues unrelated to the sprint
   - Announcements
