Review:
- Overview of everything we have done this sprint
- What was done extra, that we did not plan?
- What did we plan, but did not get to? (and why)
- A few minutes of longterm planning: What do we want to have in about 3 sprints? (have a look at the proposal)

Out of scope:
- Detailed short term planning: that will go in the sprint planning.
