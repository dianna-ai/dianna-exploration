Sprint planning:
Why planning? Make sure we stay focused, don't go out of scope, don't run out of (relevant) tasks to do.

- How many days is everyone available?
-	Plan what we are going to do this sprint
    
    o	We can use if needed: Must have, Should have, Could have, (Won’t have) to prioritize
-	Create/update/split some issues
-	Make sure everyone can start working (initial assignment; plan how to get help if needed)
-	Summarize this sprint’s essence in a single sentence: Sprint goal
